Contemporary programming languages typically offer tools to manage exceptions in order to increase effectiveness and efficiency. Nonetheless, if the features intended for exception handling are used improperly, they can lead to the creation of anti-patterns. These anti-patterns are essentially negative programming practices that seem fitting at first but can ultimately result in disastrous outcomes. To identify the top three common anti-patterns in a Java project, we will be utilizing the AST parser. The anti-patterns we will be looking for are the generic throw, destructive wrapping, and the kitchen sink. We conduct an experiment on our tool on an open-source Java project, Cassandra.
